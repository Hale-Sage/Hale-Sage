### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Haizhi Huang (é»„æµ·æ™º)

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**. I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from **Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU)** in Xi'an, China.

ðŸ”¬ My research interests include:  
- **Vision-based UAV navigation**  
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning and adversarial games**  
- **Vision-language models (VLMs)**

I'm passionate about combining robotics, machine learning, and intelligent systems to build autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.
